# myReads

### Setup:
1. To start the myReads application, locate the myReads directory in your terminal(MAC) or your command line(PC).

2. Run the command 'npm start' to start the react server on one of your local ports. (It listens to port 3000 so make sure you have nothing active on that port)

### What is this application used for?
myReads is a way for users to store books in a neat and organized fashion.

### What can I do with this application?
Users can search for popular books stored in a database as well as render them to their bookshelf at the root directory.

The user has a choice to store their selected books between three separate bookshelves. Those bookshelves are labeled as 'Currently Read', 'Want to Read' and 'Read'. Depending on the relationship to the user, the book can be stored in one of the three shelves with a simple dropdown menu.
